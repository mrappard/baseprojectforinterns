## Runtime steps:

1. run `nodemon index.js` if you want to run the server
2. run `npm run-script dev-build` (this is for webpack 4.5), run `npm run-script build` for production build.
2. Otherwise run `npm install` to install packages
(NOTE: you should have node version ^8.9.4 or above)

## How it works
1. The bundle that renders the React app is in the dist/build folder
